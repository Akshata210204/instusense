This project develops an intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using a BiLSTM deep learning model to detect and classify different types of cyberattacks. Unlike traditional rule-based IDS, this system can identify new and complex attacks with higher accuracy and fewer false positives. The model is trained on the NSL-KDD dataset after performing feature engineering and feature selection to improve performance. A Streamlit-based web dashboard is included, allowing users to upload network traffic data, view predictions in real time, and access visual reports such as attack distribution and severity levels. Overall, the system enhances network security by providing accurate, fast, and user-friendly intrusion detection.
